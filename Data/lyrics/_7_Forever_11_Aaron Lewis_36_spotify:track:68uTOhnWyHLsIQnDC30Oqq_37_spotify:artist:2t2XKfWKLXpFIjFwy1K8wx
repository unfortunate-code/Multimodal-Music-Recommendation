Forever Lyrics
Another cheap high rise hotel room
Another place, another show
Another meaningless destination
With nowhere to go

Another time to say "I love you"
Another time to say "goodnight"
Another time to hear a dial tone
'Cause no one wants to fight, why should we fight

'Cause I can see it in your eyes
Is the sparkle gone forever, don't say forever
And I can feel it when we touch
Is the fire out forever, don't say forever

Another time to miss a birthday
Another time to miss my flight
I've missed so much that I don't know what I have
And what I thought I might, what I might, 'cause

I can see it in your eyes
Is the sparkle gone forever, don't say forever
And I can feel it when we touch, is the fire out forever
Don't say forever
Now I'm lyin' beside you
A stranger in your arms
We drift apart together
And come back like a storm, like a storm

Another show up in Decatur
Another one in San Antone
Somewhere else in this equator
Takes me far away from home, I'm comin' home, cause

I can see it in your eyes
The sparkle shines forever, this is forever
And I can feel it when we touch
The fire burns forever, this is foreverEmbed
