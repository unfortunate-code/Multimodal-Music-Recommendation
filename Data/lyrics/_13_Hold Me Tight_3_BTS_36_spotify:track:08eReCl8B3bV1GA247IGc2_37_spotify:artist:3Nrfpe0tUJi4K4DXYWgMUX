BTS - 잡아줘 (Hold Me Tight) (English Translation) Lyrics
I empty my wineglass and loneliness fills me
I should’ve just given in, why did I argue over it?
Even the trash bag thrown in the streets makes a lonely sound in the wind
All I did was color you in my paper
But I look again and the drawing’s already finished
We’re cellphones, fall and we’ll be broken, you know it too
Your scent is what makes me complete
Come over and hug me

I can only see you
You are all I can see
Look, I’m unfair against all but you
Now I can’t live a day without you, please

Hold me tight, hug me
Can you trust me? Can you trust me? Can you trust me?
Pull me in tight
Hold me tight, hug me
Can you trust me? Can you trust me?
Please, please, please pull me in and hug me

You're still shining
You still smell like a flower
Now trust me, hold me again
So I can feel you, hold me
I can’t breathe without you
I’m nothing without you
Open my closed heart, drench my heart
So I can feel you, hold me
Your arms, your warmth, your heart
I beg to see them again
In this moment, the warm flower wind
And that cloudless sky
Even the sky without a single cloud
Everything feels cold, that clear sky is all dark
How can I breathe when I’m a corpse without you?
It hurts, I always cry, cry, cry
I go crazy, I’m tired without you
I keep thinking about you
I ha-hate it all, ha-hate every day
It makes me cry, ring ding dong
If there’s a chance I’ll catch you
I’ll run, start the count down
I’m ready to get hurt like thorns, I hug you again

I can only see you
You are all I can see
Look, I’m unfair against all but you
Now I can’t live a day without you, please

Hold me tight, hug me
Can you trust me? Can you trust me? Can you trust me?
Pull me in tight
Hold me tight, hug me
Can you trust me? Can you trust me?
Please, please, please pull me in and hug me
Your cold face tells me everything said in words
Our breakup pulls toward me like high tide
I know it’ll soon be our last but I can’t let you go
Don’t say, don’t go, just hug me quietly, girl

Hold me tight, hug me
Trust me, trust me, trust me
Hold me tight, hug me
Can you trust me? Can you trust me?
Please, please, please pull me in and hug me

You're still shining
You still smell like a flower
Now trust me, hold me again
So I can feel you, hold me6Embed
