French Navy LyricsSpent a week in a dusty library
Waiting for some words to jump at me
We met by a trick of fate
French navy my sailor mate
We met by the moon on a silvery lake
You came my way
Said, I want you to stay
You with your dietary restriction
Said you loved me with a lot of conviction
I was waiting to be struck by lightning
Waiting for somebody exciting
Like you
Oh, the thing that you do
You make me go ooooh
With the thing that you do (you do, you do)

I wanted to control it
But love, I couldn't hold it
I wanted to control it
But love, I couldn't hold it
I'll be criticized for lending out my art
I was criticized for letting you break my heart
Why would I stand for disappointed looks?
I'm fully grown, but I'm on tenterhooks
Ooh with the looks, on tenterhooks
Ooh with the looks, the looks, the looks
I wanted to control it
But love, I couldn't hold it
I wanted to control it
But love, I couldn't hold it
Relationships were something I used to do
Convince me they are better for me and you
We met by a trick of fate
French navy, my sailor

I wanted to control it
But love, I couldn't hold it
I wanted to control it
But love, I couldn't hold it1Embed
