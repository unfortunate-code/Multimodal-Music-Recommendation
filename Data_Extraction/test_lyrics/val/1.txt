How long can lovers stand to prove they were right?

Why did I fold my hand?
Why choose another fight?

How long would we have gone to know we shouldn't stay?

I saw you walk the wire
I watched you burn away

And somehow it moved me
Your love has powers over me
Oh what dream is this?
Somehow it towers over me

Send your love to move me
My world has powered over me
In perfect ruins
Somehow it towers over me

Who said we had it all?
Our hearts no longer lie
Who knew the veil would fall?
Who'd guess that we would cry?

What more were we to do?
Two souls who had their fill
Your love it keeps me here
You keep me wondering still

And somehow it moved me
Your love has powers over me
Oh what dream is this?
Somehow it towers over me

Send your love to move me
My world has powered over me
In perfect ruins
Somehow it towers over me
